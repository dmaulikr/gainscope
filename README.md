# gainscope

Note: I am a supreme idiot and somehow managed to delete all of my previous commits, so the only one available is my most recent one from the app store.

This is officially the first original iOS app I have built. It is a fitness-specialized map search that finds all the nearest coffee shops, gyms, and restaurants around you. It includes special pins for popular places like Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Crossfit gyms, the Y, Chipotle, etc.

Main APIs used:
- Yelp
- Uber
