##  Installation
You can install this library in 2 ways

### Manually

Copy [EasyTransition.swift](EasyTransition/EasyTransition.swift) and [UIView+Constraints.swift](EasyTransition/UIView+Constraints.swift) to your project and give me some beer.

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate EasyTransition into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'EasyTransition', '~> 1.1'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate EasyTransition into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "indevizible/EasyTransition" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `EasyTransition.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Usage
Import and declare EasyTransition:
```swift
import EasyTransition

class ViewController: UIViewController {
  var transition: EasyTransition?
}
```
Customise transition and present normally:

```swift
let vc = TargetViewController()
transition = EasyTransition(attachedViewController: vc)
transition?.transitionDuration = 0.4
transition?.direction = .Right
transition?.margins = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 100, bottom: 0, right: 0)
presentViewController(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
You can also make a direction from a corner:
```swift
transition?.direction = [.Top,.Right]
```
